description: "I'm a PhD student at the [Developmental Neuroscience Lab](https://www.jacobscenter.uzh.ch/en/research/developmental_neuroscience.html) at the __University of ZÃ¼rich__. I'm interested in how children learn in interaction with others. Specifically, my research focuses on the intergenerational transfer of socioemotional skills. To address this topic, I use neuroimaging, behavioural measures, and computational models. In my research, I support open science practices."
